    * that should be reduced in its environment.

    * executes the duplicated block.  Concurrently, the array of the
    * current inner node is reduced sequentially (thus, `parReduce`
    * consumes CPU cycles itself).
    *
    * Finally, a future is created (using `flatMap` and `map`) which
    * is resolved when both subtrees have been reduced and the final
    * sum has been computed.
